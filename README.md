I decided to just go ahead and redo my HW1 and port it over to bootstrap rather than using a whole new template.  My reasoning is that if I had to use it from scratch and make it fit the layout I already had, it would force me get more comfortable with it and how to use it.  Also would if it wasn't working like how I want it, I would then have to modify the css.
